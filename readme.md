This repo contains python code to send bulk emails at once from a .csv file.
To add your emails add them in 'emails.csv' file
You can send upto 500 emails at once because that's the limit set by gmail.
Try to avoid sending many emails from one single account otherwise google may consider them spam mails and restrict your account.

If your account has 2FA enabled then you must generate an app password to send emails through smtp
